                    <p>Margaret and Frances Macdonald were two key pioneers of the Art Nouveau Movement who sought to transgress against the gender restrictions of the 18th century, emerging into a new century full of hope for liberation, both artistically and sexually.

                    <p> In 1890, both sisters registered to enter the Glasgow School of Art, where they met Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair, and would go on to create the infamous ‘Glasgow Four’ artistic collective, particularly distorting and challenging female representation. Eventually Margaret married Charles and Frances married Herbert.</p>
                    <p>The Vienna Succession was a movement catalyzed by a break with the academic style in Vienna in 1897, where the ‘Glasgow Four’s’ work was well received. Despite Margaret’s success in Vienna, her work was greatly criticized and overshadowed by Charles’ legacy.

Particularly his ‘Golden Era’ categorized by the use of gold leaf and decadent, rich colours, was of importance in the Art Nouveau Movement. </p>

                    <p> However, following the creation of three commissioned ceiling pieces for the University of Vienna, his reputation was completely tarnished. The three pieces titled Philosophy (1900), Medicine (1901) and Jurisprudence (1907) were all incredibly beautiful, but at the time were all deemed sexually explicit and inappropriate; a common theme seenmongst aritsts of the Art Nouveau period as it was a period of liberation experimentation for many in this world.<br> During World War Two all three paintings were destroyed by Nazi troops. </p>

                    <p>Despite leading a life tragically cut short at the age of 25 by Tuberculosis, Aubrey Beardsley was, and continues to be one of the most influential artists during the Art Nouveau Movement and modern-day artworks. He was a graphic artist and illustrator who was considered the most influential master of Art Nouveau graphics. His work, though considered greatly controversial, was extremely successful and mainly explored themes of sexuality, eroticism and irony. These topics were seen as absolutely scandalous and unheard of in his time, so they were considered very controversial themes to be creating art about. Beardsley’s most infamous work was unquestionably his commission for poet Oscar Wilde; ‘Salome’, a one act tragedy defying the rules of gender and sexuality. </p>

                    <p>Ocsar Wilde described the work as “the naughty scribbles a precocious schoolboy makes on the margin of his copybooks.” which he meant as admiring praise rather than belittlement, marvelling at the flamboyancy of each piece. </p>

                <div id="col14" class="column">
                    <p id="col4-text1">Alphonse Mucha, Czech born illustrator, had created by far the most recognisable style within the Art Nouveau Movement, despite hating his formal association with the Art Nouveau Movement. His posters had an egalitarian nature and popularized the aesthetic ‘Le Style Mucha’ including mostly decadent women with long flowing hair, optimistic stances and colours and botanical references. </p>
                    <p id="col4-text2">However, Mucha’s big break came from the famous stage actress Sarah Bernhardt. She commissioned him to design a poster for the play she was to star in, ‘Gismonda’, a Greek melodrama. After completing this commission and now having associations with Bernhardt, Mucha propelled his career forward and had an influx of commission requests, being the source of popularisation for ‘La Style Mucha’ and making it as recognisable at it even in modern day audiences. </p>

                    <p>Overall, the Art nouveau Movement had undoubtedly influenced every medium in this current day such as the development of printmaking (particularly in lithography), making more unconventional styling choices in architecture and generally exploring more themes within artworks that society deems taboo, as these artists did above with gender and sexuality in their own respective times. </p>
